This application is designed to help track different restaurants that are either recommended to you, recently opened, or just any one that sounds good. It's an easy refrence to help answer the question of what to eat and to get out of feeling like you only ever go to the same few places.

## How To Use:
When you find out about a new restaurant you would like to try, simply put it's name into the "Add Restauarnt" field, and click the add button. After you visit the restaurant click the "Visited" button and the restaurant will move to the already visited list.
